Eveliom
=======

An [Eliom][eliom] library for Eve Online.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library contains two parts :
- A server part, which depends on Eliom and allow to get information from HTTP headers provided by the IGB.
- A client part, which depends on js\_of\_ocaml and allow to use custom js functions available in the IGB.

They may be additional things (like API or CREST) in the future.
